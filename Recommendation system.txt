A)Item based collaborative filtering finds similarity patterns between items and recommends them to users based on the computed information, whilst user based 
finds similar users and gives them recommendations based on what other people with similar consumption patterns appreciated.

2. What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?
A)It groups users based on similar behavior, recommending new items according to group characteristics. Collaborative filtering is an information retrieval method 
that recommends items to users based on how other users with similar preferences and behavior have interacted with that item.
