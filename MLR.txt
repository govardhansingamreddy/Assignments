1.What is Normalization & Standardization and how is it helpful?
A)Normalization rescales feature values within a predefined range, often between 0 and 1, which is particularly useful for
 models where the scale of features varies greatly. In contrast, standardization centers data around the mean (0) and scales it according to the standard deviation (1).

2.What techniques can be used to address multicollinearity in multiple linear regression?
A)The potential solutions include the following: Remove some of the highly correlated independent variables. Linearly combine the independent variables, such as adding them together. Partial least squares regression 
uses principal component analysis to create a set of uncorrelated components to include in the model.
